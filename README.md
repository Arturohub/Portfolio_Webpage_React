I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024.

Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time.

Hereby my portfolio's webpage. This is my most special project so far, as I tried to showcase all my self-learnt knowledge and also my creative side. I will for sure create more websites in the future, but this one will always be close to my heart.

Enjoy the design and feel free to write me a message commenting me about improvements or ideas you might have! Or even better, to hire me :D
